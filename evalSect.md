## Evaluation
## Methodology of Evaluating our Designs


In order to evaluate how our product would be received by users we used five techniques throughout the process; paper prototyping, wireframing, an idea matrix, questionnaires, semi-structured interviews.

*come back to this at the end
- intro/abstract
- why did you use certain methods of evaluation for your particular design - qual and quant
- summarise the rest of the section
- how did the different methods link with each other?*

Below is a short summary of our 5 main techniques of evaluating our design through users. Following this, we talk about them in more detail in our timeline of Evaluation where we discuss the kind of feedback we felt was necessary at different stages of the development process.

*perhpaps expand the following by:
- going into more detail on the explanation front
- ensuring each headings' links with the other headings are explained
- give an example for the things you can make examples from
- -	talk in more detail about each thing e.g â€“ Paper Prottyping wizard of oz
- ensure you are talking about 'what is this method?'*

### Paper prototyping
This process involved drawing our first interpretations of what we envisaged our website to look like on paper and then showing and observing potential users' interaction with it.  
*expand on paper prototyping - wizard of oz etc in google docs*
To learn more about how our paper prototyping allowed us, at a very early stage, obtain our first UX feedback and its essential role in our early ideation see the UX section *link to UX section*. We go into more detail about the process of paper prototyping in the timeline below.  


### Wireframing

Wireframing enabled us to create an interactive version of our undeveloped website that users could access on a desktop through a link [Link display text - like this one for our second wireframe!](https://zaki744910.invisionapp.com/console/share/4Y2FIC1NV7/584973219). For example, we could draw parts of the website that we had not yet built onto screenshots of the website as it looked at the time.  
Please see our UX section *link to UX section* where we discuss how users were able to engage with our website and leave comments on what they thought about their experience with it.

### Idea Matrix  

*picture of idea matrix up to date*

Another method we used in evaluating our designs was an idea matrix. This was an excel spreadsheet that came to be extremely useful in prioritising what changes we were going to make to the website throughout the development process. We were able to populate the idea matrix with feedback data from both the questionnaires and semi-structured interviews.

### Questionnaires

Our group used questionnaires both as a qualitative and quantitative method of evaluating our designs. It was our main form of quantitative feedback as we were able to send a link *insert link* to as many users as we could who had just used one of our wireframes or been shown our most up to date website on a local host. This way, we could gain insights at scale into how users interpreted our website through them answering questions such as "Would you recommend this product to a friend?", "Do you think this website is solving a serious problem?" or "How would you improve this website?".   


### Semi-structured interviews  
These interviews were carried out throughout the development process all the way from paper-prototyping at the beginning, to presenting the website on a local host in its most complete form. We saw interviews as the main form of qualitative feedback.


## Timeline of Evaluation Methods

### Stage 1: FEEDBACK ON EARLY IDEATION 21/2/21
21/2/21: Paper prototyping was a key part of getting our idea off the ground and taking an abstract concept in our heads to a more consolidated one. Although our idea of how the website would look was completely premature, this was our first attempt at getting a feel for how users would interact with the website. Users were able to give us a sense of direction in this way before we started coding anything

24/2/21: Paper prototyping naturally led us to start conducting semi-structured interviews. The process of paper prototyping, as explained above(link to above), somewhat resembled the process of an interview. As a group, we ensured that we conducted such interviews with people after they had undergone the paper prototyping from this date onwards. This method of qualitative evaluation continued throughout the rest of our development process, being conducted with users after they had seen the wireframe or been shown the most up to date version of the website on a local host.

### Stage 2: MOVE TO WIREFRAME 17/3/21
[First wireframe](/Users/zakigill/Desktop/1st Wireframe.png)  
17/3/21: So far, our evaluation was based on feedback from users who had only seen our ideas written on paper. At the point that we had built the first map interface part we were able to take our prototyping one step further by showing them a wireframe where we were able to make the undeveloped website look as it would do in the future. We decided to use a wireframe because it allowed us to evaluate how users thought of our design before it was actually coded.

[Second Wireframe](/Users/zakigill/Desktop/2nd wireframe.png)   
5/4/21: There reached a point where our first wireframe became out of date in relation to the level of development of the website. At the same time, we felt that the website was too undeveloped to be used by users. Therefore, we built a second wireframe so we could continue to evaluate our website against user preferences which enabled us to gain feedback from users at different stages during the development process as we built our website ahead of time.  


### Stage 3: INVOLVEMENT OF QUANTITATIVE FEEDBACK 24/3/21
*screenshot of 5 point likert scale*

24/3/21: Although we felt that interviews were a good source of creating qualitative feedback, we made a decision to try and increase our sample size when it came to evaluating our product and attempt to create some quantitative feedback. In order to achieve a quantitative metric for how a user would feel about our product, we decided it was necessary to ask some 'how much' and 'how many' questions at scale to our users. Very shortly after we started showing our first wireframe to users, we created a questionnaire that we could send alongside the link to the wireframe. Click on this link to see it! *link the questionnaire*. We tried to push the quantitative aspect of the questionnaires by using 5 point likert scale, as seen in the above figure.  

*screenshot of the last question, and or question 7*
The questionnaires themselves did in fact hold a qualitative functionality to them. This was mainly in two of the questions, seen above, where we prompted the user for a response.  


In total we produced three  questionairres. The first two were sent to users alongside the wireframes and the last one was filled out by users after they had used the website on a local host. The last two questionnaires asked the same questions as the first, but we improved it slightly. *Give example of how you improved this*  



### Stage 4: INVOLVEMENT OF IDEA MATRIX 30/3/21


### Stage 5: MOVE FROM WIREFRAMING TO PRSENTING TO USERS VIA LOCALHOST 5/4/21

We continued using wireframes as a method of evaluation for our designs until the point  where our website was functional whereby we could show users the actual website through a local host.

- we were ready at the end of sprint 3 (27th march ) but we didn't end up actually doing semi-structured interviews and getting people to fill out the questionnaires after looking at the website on our laptops
- reference sprint 3

# Conclusion
scope and future work must go here...
Perhaps hometown / lived location could be something you grab from the user too

some more things we can add to the documentation
this is really important guys
this feedback
"I mean a user history mode that is mapped could be quite interesting, however, there is one thing I want you to think about (not necessarily to develop anything, but just to think about for your future work section of the report). Simply, how will this data be used and who will use it?

If I clicked on your Edgware Earthquake post, how could I support you? This is where you make the jump from raising awareness, to going further

### Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work, e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc).

### Reflective discussion of the success of the project. How well did your project fulfil the brief? Were all of your own objectives met

### This is a chance to reflect on how coronavirus has affected your project (remote working practices etc)

### Discussion of Social and Ethical implications of your work.

### Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)

One extension idea we have involves further inter-user interaction and communication in a local area. Here is the idea, demonstrated with an example: 'Bristol is notorious for its limited parking. On a particular residential road, there is a bus stop that has been out-of-service for years. Despite paying for a parking permit, residents have been told that they are not allowed to park on the bus stop even if that means parking on another road. Residents are upset as they often find themselves struggling to park after a busy day at work. Naturally, they individually take to EmoteMap to express their feelings. To their surprise, they discover that others feel the same way. This is because EmoteMap has identified multiple people within an area expressing similar feelings over the same issue. EmoteMap then asks the individuals if they would like to initialise a discussion group, in hope of resolving the local issue.' This extension would involve the ability to identify multiple users within a local area reporting the same issue. Furthermore, some form of chat service would need to be implemented. !!!!Perhaps we could briefly mention what tools could be used to achieve this?!!!!!!!

At a late stage in our development, one user made an important point on privacy: they were concerned about sharing their location when making an Emote Post. This is a valid concern and we questioned how we may be able to deal with this issue in future development of the project. Submitting Emote Posts without some form of geolocation voids the project's idea entirely. We therefore propose an alternative direction: to give users the ability to pin their posts to an area (such as a district), instead of a precise location. We believe this would be a good balance between privacy, and having the ability to see trends in emotion across different areas of the globe. It would be interesting to survey whether such a feature would encourage those previously concerned over privacy to then use the site.
