scope and future work must go here...
Perhaps hometown / lived location could be something you grab from the user too

some more things we can add to the documentation
this is really important guys
this feedback
"I mean a user history mode that is mapped could be quite interesting, however, there is one thing I want you to think about (not necessarily to develop anything, but just to think about for your future work section of the report). Simply, how will this data be used and who will use it?

If I clicked on your Edgware Earthquake post, how could I support you? This is where you make the jump from raising awareness, to going further

### Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work, e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc).

### Reflective discussion of the success of the project. How well did your project fulfil the brief? Were all of your own objectives met

### This is a chance to reflect on how coronavirus has affected your project (remote working practices etc)

### Discussion of Social and Ethical implications of your work.

### Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)

One extension idea we have involves further inter-user interaction and communication in a local area. Here is the idea, demonstrated with an example: 'Bristol is notorious for its limited parking. On a particular residential road, there is a bus stop that has been out-of-service for years. Despite paying for a parking permit, residents have been told that they are not allowed to park on the bus stop even if that means parking on another road. Residents are upset as they often find themselves struggling to park after a busy day at work. Naturally, they individually take to EmoteMap to express their feelings. To their surprise, they discover that others feel the same way. This is because EmoteMap has identified multiple people within an area expressing similar feelings over the same issue. EmoteMap then asks the individuals if they would like to initialise a discussion group, in hope of resolving the local issue.' This extension would involve the ability to identify multiple users within a local area reporting the same issue. Furthermore, some form of chat service would need to be implemented. !!!!Perhaps we could briefly mention what tools could be used to achieve this?!!!!!!!

At a late stage in our development, one user made an important point on privacy: they were concerned about sharing their location when making an Emote Post. This is a valid concern and we questioned how we may be able to deal with this issue in future development of the project. Submitting Emote Posts without some form of geolocation voids the project's idea entirely. We therefore propose an alternative direction: to give users the ability to pin their posts to an area (such as a district), instead of a precise location. We believe this would be a good balance between privacy, and having the ability to see trends in emotion across different areas of the globe. It would be interesting to survey whether such a feature would encourage those previously concerned over privacy to then use the site.
