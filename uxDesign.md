# UX Design

## Design Process and Early prototyping and ideation (including mood boards and paper prototyping)

### Idea formulation

This time was used to get to know the other group members and project brief itself. Having all come from different backgrounds, from music to engineering, a lot of varied and interesting project ideas were put forward. After some discussion we drafted up 4 potential ideas:

**Higher or lower:** A simple game in which the user was asked which was item is "higher or lower", if they get the answer correct they are given a fact about the item which was lower. Below is a small demonstration on the topic of population size but question topics could be on a large variety of things:

The game intention of this game was to be addictive, fun and educational.

**Altitude explorer:** A 2D platformer game with similar mechanics to the app [Doodle Jump] but the user explores different altitudes on earth and in space. The player starts at the bottom of the sea and works their way up into space. As they travel up through different levels they learn facts about what is present at each altitude. For example at 10,927m below sea level the user would be told that this was the deepest manned sea dive ever recorded or at 10,668m above sea level they would be informed that this is the average height at which passenger planes fly. As the user went higher they would then learn about different planets and objects in space. Similar to the other idea this served to be entertaining but also educational.

**Musical instruments through time:** A web page where users can browse musical instruments through time and when they are clicked the sound of the instrument is played. Aimed to teach users about musical anthropology in an engaging way, an interesting topic which our group consider to be overlooked and undervalued compared to other areas of music.

**EmoteMap:** A geographical diary where users can post diary entries which include their current location. Users can then look on the map at their archived posts and see how they were feeling in certain locations. This website idea aims to help users track and improve upon their mental wellbeing.

A lot of time was spent discussing which project idea to use. The idea needed to be useful, original and also fit the brief. We decided that although we felt all the ideas were good, EmoteMap addressed the particularly relevant issue of mental health and isolation. COVID-19 has left many people isolated and struggling to cope with ongoing lockdowns. We decided to use the geographical diary element from the EmoteMap idea but make it so posts can be seen by other users online, making users feel less isolated and more connected. All group members agreed this idea had great potential and decided to finalise this as our project idea.



Our first real visualisation of the website consisted of a paper prototype. This ensured all members of the group were on the same page (no pun intended) regarding the initial layout, and allowed us to easily and to quickly make adjustments during a group discussion. Our original prototype is shown here:

### Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders.

### UX approach – design heuristics/approach, design methods (design fiction / heuristics)
stuff

### Understanding of user group (questionnaires / user stories / interviews)
To ensure that we continued to develop a website with the user in mind, we gathered user feedback throughout the project. This started as early as our paper prototypes, and proved to be useful. For example, the first paper prototype (which was also shared) demonstrated that new users would be greeted wth an empty globe. They would then have to signup before gaining the ability to interact with the map. This was our initial plan because we wanted to encourage users to signup, however, user feedback revealed something important to us: the user was confused as to what signing up would allow them to do (aka they did not understand the purpose of the website straight away). We thought this may start to turn away newcomers. We changed the paper prototype to demonstrate to users that they could zoom in/out of the map, and read EmotePosts as soon as they enter the website. This also meant that the ‘serious play’ aspect was integrated immediately, and the user would learn in an active manner. We decided to include a ‘signup’ option on a sidebar. After implementing these changes, users grasped the concept much quicker when shown the paper prototype. The image below shows the changes we made to our paper prototype as a response:

The wireframe was also shared with external individuals, to gather further feedback (in the form of an accompanying quetionnaire). The results of the questionnaire revealed potential improvements, which we then implemented. For example, one of the questions asked: ‘How would you go about improving the website?’. One answer suggested including a key for the different coloured markers. The image below shows the final state of the key that we decided to implement as a response to this feedback.

### Wireframes and interaction flow diagrams for final key subsystems.
Our paper prototype served well at forming an initial visualisation of the website. In order to gain more useful feedback, we needed to demonstrate the website using a closer representation of a working product. Logically, a wireframe was the next best step. We used [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com) to do this. Click [here](https://zaki744910.invisionapp.com/console/share/NJ2D65MNBU/572059598) to go to our interactive wireframe.
