        <p class="boxText">
            EmoteMap exists to help address the global epidemic
            of mental health issues. Inspired by our desire to share
            emotions, EmoteMap helps you to connect with others
            around the globe. Here's an example scenario that demonstrates
            how EmoteMap works:
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's say your government has announced another national
            lockdown. You may start to feel less positive, and isolated.
            You open up EmoteMap to make a post. You submit your
            happiness rating (1-5), and the reason as to why you are
            feeling how you are. EmoteMap will pin your anonymous post
            to the globe, and will show you the pins and posts of others
            who have reported similar levels of happiness and for similar
            reasons. Furthermore, you can search pins and posts by keywords,
            allowing you to see trends across the world.
            <br>

            The idea is to remind users that they are never alone in their
            feelings. We currently live in a world that is dominated by a type
            of social media that thrives on boastfulness and desire. EmoteMap
            strives to be the opposite: to connect people based on real,
            non-hidden emotion.

            You are not alone...
